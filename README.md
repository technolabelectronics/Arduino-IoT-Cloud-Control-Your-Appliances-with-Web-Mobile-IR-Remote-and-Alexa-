# Introduction
Arduino few day back launched the successor of Arduino UNO R3 board, that is , Arduino UNO R4 and it has two variants, One is Arduino UNO R4 Minima and the second one is Arduino UNO R4 WIFI.
This Arduino UNO R4 WIFI has a ESP32 chipset inbuilt, So we expect WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity. And with WIFI connectivity we got the Support of Arduino IoT Cloud as well.
This New Arduino UNO R4 board has the same form factor as the Arduino UNO R3 board. And the Pinout is exactly same as R3 board.
Having the same form factor and Pinout ,Now we can easily use all the shield or module of Arduino UNO R3 with this new R4 board.

Last year I designed a learning PCB for beginners which is kind of Arduino UNO R3 shield, Just Put the shield on the Arduino UNO R3 board and easily make cool home-automation projects….it’s a kind of plug and play thing.
If we want Bluetooth connectivity with Arduino UNO R3  we need external Bluetooth module.

Now this Arduino UNO R4 Board has ESP32 Chipset inbuilt so no need of any external Bluetooth or WIFI Module.

Using this shield with the Arduino UNO R4 WIFI Board ,Now we can easily Make IOT Project as well.
In this Article,  I will let you how can we make a home-automation project using this Arduino UNO R4 WIFI board & Arduino IoT Cloud.
With this Project, we will able to control two relays using a smartphone App , from web dashboard, from IR remote and from the Alexa smart speaker.

This is going to be very easy and interesting home-automation project.
